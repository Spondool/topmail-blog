__Have you ever checked if your account has been breached?__

There are quite a number of account holders to date who have not checked whether their account has actually been hacked. This could be down to two main reasons:

They have no idea how to check if their account had been breached.

They donâ€™t care i.e. they believe there is nothing within their personal account(s) that would be of value to anyone.

What people seem to forget is that when an email account is breached it gives the hacker the ability to access your password, which in some cases you use for a lot of other online accounts, of which these could have valued private information stored.

It is very important that each time you hear about a reported breach of an online service you may use, that you take proactive steps to protect your account(s). Log into your accounts and change your passwords, specifically in respect to any accounts which hold private or financial information.

__How do I check if my account has been hacked?__

The good news is that checking if your account has been hacked is quite simple. Data breaches can expose a wealth of sensitive information. Hackers have accessed billions of usernames, email addresses, passwords and even credit card numbers. Your information could be right there in the hackers' hands, so it is important to check your accounts today!
